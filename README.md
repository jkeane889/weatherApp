# weatherApp
This is a React weather application as a pseudo coding challenge

## Goals of the Application

* Display a 5-day weather forecast, where each day shows high and low temperatures, and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy days.
* Use fake, hard-coded data until the front-end is rendering correctly
* Add the ability to click on a day, and see its hourly forecast. You can just maintain the current view in the top-level App state.
* Add [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) to the project (`npm install react-router`) and follow the quick start guide to add routes, such that '/' shows the 5 day forecast, and '/[name of day]' shows the hourly forecast for a particular day
* Sign up for a free API key from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/), to fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app
* Real fancy? Add graphics library like [vx](https://vx-demo.now.sh/) and follow the examples to add a graph of the temperature over the course of the week
